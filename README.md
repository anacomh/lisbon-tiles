#Lisbon Tiles Playground

Hello! I am Anah Assumpção, a creative UX/UI Designer, who loves Lisbon Tiles and like them to be attached with their history.

Lisbon tiles Playground is a free collection of repeatable SVG background patterns based on amazing Lisbon tiles and their cool history. Its free and it will always be.

If you love to make patterns from Lisbon tiles, please share by submiting to the playground! 

This website uses JavaScript and Jquery to manipulate SVG and generate a CSS code.
